                    Today's world has gradually transformed into an everlasting rat race which often demands
                    conceptual clarity for excellance.However,ironically schools often fail to generate intrest in concepts which leads
                    to lack of conceptual clarity in students.Though schools are the first place where a students  experinces competition
                    in all feilds,it's controvershial that the competition students face in competative exams is dramatically
                    higher than competition faced by them in the school.

                    Keeping this in mind,we,at Edu Next are developing this website for students in primary school to generate intrest
                    in studies for conceptual clarity.The videos on our website are deeply searched for and compared with other videos
                    to get the best ones and the provided notes are handwritten.<br><br>
                    We are constntly trying to improve our website and hope that in future we will be able to provide notes and videos
                    for students in secondary school to engage them in fun learning for a bright future.<br><Br><Br><br><br>Thank You.<Br><Br><br>
